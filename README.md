# Mifobio-A141 - Companion Notebook to the Digitial Holography workshop

Welcome to workshop A141 on digital holography for label free imaging of biological tissues! This notebook will give you a grasp on how interferometry is used to measure the electrical field, and how to process this field to recover an image.

For the notebook "Atelier 141 - Digital Holography.ipynb" to work properly on your laptop, all you will need is:
- a working Python installation. Use Anaconda if you've never done it before.
- Jupyter notebook installed
- Numpy and Matplotlib installed.

# How to get started

```
git clone https://github.com/nguigs/mifobio-digital-holo.git
cd mifobio-digital-holo
pip install -e .
jupyter notebook
```

Enjoy the workshop!
